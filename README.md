# learnTF

This project is aiming to using selenium to retrieve soccer betting odds as well as soccer game score data from http://zx.500.com/zc/lsdz.php
and then use sci-learn and tensorflow to predict a soccer game result with betting odds

test2 is to retrieve game id according to session number

gamedata is to retrieve betting odds and score

SVM and soccer guess is sci-learn and tensorflow. 

so far can only achieve around 50% accuracy... maybe there is any necessary link between betting odds and game result.
